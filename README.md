# How to use:
Open the Weatherly App from this link
-(https://weather-app-liart-delta.vercel.app/)

Search the weather weather data by entering a city name in the search bar and press enter or click the search button.







# Tech Used:

HTML,CSS and Javascript:

The front-end development of the app.

Weather API: Retrives weather data based on users location.

# Optimizations
The search button was lighter before but I adjusted the hex to a darker hue to highlight the text so users can see it clearly.
For a clear resolution of the weather profileicons I pulled the api image from 2x to 4x for a higher DPI.

# Resources
I used the "openweathermap" API for the project which is a free API.
